    <h2>Materials That Were Used :</h2>

      The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks which most believe to have been transported from
      nearby quarries. The Tura limestone used
      for the casing was quarried across the river.Ancient Egyptians cut stone into rough blocks by hammering grooves
      into natural stone faces, inserting wooden
      wedges, then soaking these with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, breaking off workable
      chunks. Once the blocks were cut, they were
      carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid. It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of
      limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite
      , and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction of the Great Pyramid.</font>

      Many alternative, often contradictory, theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid's construction
      techniques.One mystery of the pyramid's construction
      is its planning.The original entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north, 17 metres vertically above ground
      level and 7.29 metres east
      of the center line of the pyramid. From this original entrance, there is a Descending Passage 0.96 metres high and
      1.04 metres wide, which goes down at an
      angle of 26Â° 31'23" through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it. After 105.23 metres,
      the passage becomes level and continues for
      an additional 8.84 metres to the lower Chamber, which appears not to have been finished. There is a continuation
      of the horizontal passage in the south wall
      of the lower chamber; there is also a pit dug in the floor of the chamber 28.2 metres from the entrance is a
      square hole in the roof of the Descending
      Passage. Originally concealed with a slab of stone, this is the beginning of the Ascending Passage. The Ascending
      Passage is 39.3 metres long, as wide and
      high as the Descending Passage and slopes up at almost precisely the same angle to reach the Grand Gallery. The
      lower end of the Ascending Passage is closed
      by three huge blocks of granite, each about 1.5 metres long. One must use the Robbers' Tunnel to access the
      Ascending Passage. At the start of the Grand
      Gallery on the right-hand side there is a hole cut in the wall. This is the start of a vertical shaft which
      follows an irregular path through the masonry
      of the pyramid to join the Descending Passage. Also at the start of the Grand Gallery there is the Horizontal
      Passage leading to the "Queen's Chamber".
      The passage is 1.1m high for most of its length, but near the chamber there is a step in the floor, after which
      the passage is 1.73 metres high.</font>
