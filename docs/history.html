      <p>From the beginning of the Dynastic Era (2950 B.C.), royal tombs were carved into rock and covered with
        flat-roofed rectangular structures known as mastabas, which were precursors to the pyramids. The oldest known
        pyramid in Egypt was built around 2630 B.C. at Saqqara, for the third dynasty's King Djoser. :
        Though other pyramids were attempted in the 3rd Dynasty after Djoser, it was the 4th
        Dynasty, transitioning from the step pyramid to true pyramid shape, which gave rise to the great pyramids of
        Meidum, Dahshur, and Giza. The last pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty, Shepseskaf, did not build a pyramid and
        beginning
        in the 5th Dynasty; for various reasons, the massive scale and precision of construction decreased significantly
        leaving these later pyramids smaller, less well-built, and often hastily constructed. By the end of the 6th
        Dynasty, pyramid building had largely ended and it was not until the Middle Kingdom that large pyramids were
        built
        again, though instead of stone, mudbrick was the main construction material.

        The designations of the pyramidsKhufu, Khafre, and Menkaurecorrespond to the kings for
        whom they were built. The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the
        second king of the 4th dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the largest of the three, the length of each
        side
        at the base averaging 755.75 feet (230 metres) and its original height being 481.4 feet (147 metres). The middle
        pyramid was built for Khafre (Greek: Chephren), the fourth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty; the structure
        measures 707.75 feet (216 metres) on each side and was originally 471 feet (143 metres) high. The southernmost
        and
        last pyramid to be built was that of Menkaure (Greek: Mykerinus), the fifth king of the 4th dynasty; each side
        measures 356.5 feet (109 metres), and the structures completed height was 218 feet (66 metres). All three
        pyramids were plundered both internally and externally in ancient and medieval times. Thus, the grave goods
        originally deposited in the burial chambers are missing, and the pyramids no longer reach their original heights
        because they have been almost entirely stripped of their outer casings of smooth white limestone; the Great
        Pyramid, for example, is now only 451.4 feet (138 metres) high. That of Khafre retains the outer limestone
        casing
        only at its topmost portion. Constructed near each pyramid was a mortuary temple, which was linked via a sloping
        causeway to a valley temple on the edge of the Nile floodplain. Also nearby were subsidiary pyramids used for
        the
        burials of other members of the royal family.
